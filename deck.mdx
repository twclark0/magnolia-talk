## Let's interview!

# :flushed:

---

# Live Results

See what what your peers are choosing

---

The truth is, we all get nervous when interviewing.

# :grimacing:

---

This talk won't get you an instant pay raise :crossed_fingers:

My hope is to _*help*_ prepare you for common _*buzzword*_ questions

Be prepared. Be proactive. Believe in yourself. :muscle:

## Be prepared to back it up.

> I don’t care if a candidate knows the word “closure” or the technical definition.
> I want to find out if they understand the basic mechanics.
> If they don’t, it’s usually a clear indicator that the developer does not have a lot of experience building actual JavaScript applications.

## Look more into these concepts afterwards

# What is a closure?

###### Answer: All of the above

---

- A data privacy technique for objects
- An inner function enclosed by another function
- A stateful function

---

At the core, a function within another function

```javascript
function add(a, b) {}
```
